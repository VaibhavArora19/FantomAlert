### Integrate in your smart contract

Start integrating Fantom Alert in your smart contract using our Fantom Alert Contract interface. Remember while using Fantom Alert via smart contract the owner will be the smart contract and not your EOA(Externally Owned Account). You can make EOA as the owner using the Fantom Alert website that directly interacts with the smart contract. To visit the website click <a href="https://fantom-alert.vercel.app/">here</a>

- Import the Fantom Alert interface

```bash
import {IChannels} from "https://github.com/VaibhavArora19/FantomAlert/blob/main/hardhat/contracts/IChannels.sol";
```

- Initialize the contract

```bash
IChannels public channel = IChannels(0xddDe75Cd5cBe775A82Ca76D2080a24082Ce6927f);
```

- Now you can call the contract function and start sending notifications to your subscribersðŸ˜‰

```bash
    channel.createChannel(string calldata name, string calldata description)
```
